## What FlowX is

FlowX is a **universal application runtime** for building AI-native, cloud-native,
event-driven business applications using **compile-time orchestration**.

> Applications are not collections of services.
> Applications are **networks of business capabilities connected by executable flows**.

FlowX turns that sentence into a runtime.

### The core equation

```
Application  =  Trigger  +  Flow  +  Capability  +  Policy  +  Runtime
```

There is no Controller, no Mediator, no Handler, no Consumer, no Scheduler.
Those are not architectural concepts — they are **transport details**, and FlowX
models all of them as one thing: a **Trigger**.

---

## Five minutes to a running application

### 1. Write a capability — one unit of business meaning

```csharp
[Capability("inventory.reserve", Version = "1.0")]
public sealed class ReserveInventory : ICapability<ReserveRequest, Reservation>
{
    private readonly IInventoryStore _store;
    public ReserveInventory(IInventoryStore store) => _store = store;

    public async ValueTask<Result<Reservation>> ExecuteAsync(
        ReserveRequest input, CapabilityContext ctx, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        var ok = await _store.TryReserveAsync(input.Sku, input.Quantity, ct);
        return ok
            ? Result.Ok(new Reservation(input.Sku, input.Quantity))
            : Result.Fail<Reservation>(InventoryErrors.OutOfStock(input.Sku));
    }
}
```

It knows nothing about HTTP, Kafka or databases. You can test it with `new`.

### 2. Compose a flow — business intent, not plumbing

```csharp
[Flow("order.place", Profile = ExecutionProfile.Durable)]
[HttpTrigger("POST", "/api/v1/orders", Idempotent = true)]
[KafkaTrigger("orders.requested", Group = "order-placement")]
public sealed partial class PlaceOrderFlow : Flow<PlaceOrder, OrderPlacedResult>
{
    protected override void Define(IFlowBuilder<PlaceOrder, OrderPlacedResult> flow) => flow
        .Step<ValidateOrder>()
        .Step<ReserveInventory>().CompensateWith<ReleaseInventory>()
        .Step<CapturePayment>().WithPolicy(Policies.PaymentGateway)
        .Emit<OrderPlaced>()
        .Return(ctx => new OrderPlacedResult(ctx.Get<OrderId>()));
}
```

### 3. Run it

```bash
dotnet run --project samples/ecommerce
```

That is the whole application. The HTTP endpoint, the Kafka consumer, the retry
policy, the saga compensation, the OpenTelemetry spans, the OpenAPI document and
the machine-readable manifest are **generated at compile time** from those two
files. Nothing is discovered by reflection at start-up.

> The `ecommerce` sample needs no infrastructure at all — no database, no broker.
> Samples that use durability need PostgreSQL; [samples/README.md](samples/README.md)
> says which, and why.

---

## Architecture, from simple to complex

Four views of the same system. Read them in order; each adds one layer of detail.

### View 1 — where FlowX sits

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["ASP.NET Core · Kafka · gRPC · Cron<br/><small>transport</small>"]
    B["FlowX<br/><small>programming model + runtime</small>"]
    C["Your business capabilities"]
    D["Infrastructure<br/><small>databases · brokers · clouds</small>"]

    A --> B --> C --> D

    classDef flowx fill:#1d4ed8,stroke:#1e3a8a,color:#ffffff
    classDef yours fill:#dbeafe,stroke:#1d4ed8,color:#1e3a8a
    class B flowx
    class C yours
```

FlowX does not sit where MediatR sits. It sits one layer above: it owns the shape
of the application, not the dispatch of a message.

### View 2 — one request, end to end

The happy path, and its failure twin. Both are the same compiled plan.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant Client
    participant Trigger as HTTP trigger<br/>(generated)
    participant Engine as Flow engine
    participant Journal as Journal<br/>(PostgreSQL)
    participant Cap as Your capability

    Client->>Trigger: POST /api/v1/orders
    Trigger->>Engine: PlaceOrder (typed, already validated)
    Engine->>Journal: open instance
    loop each step in the compiled plan
        Engine->>Cap: ExecuteAsync(input, ctx, ct)
        Cap-->>Engine: Result.Ok / Result.Fail
        Engine->>Journal: commit the step boundary
    end
    Engine-->>Trigger: OrderPlacedResult
    Trigger-->>Client: 201 Created
```

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant Engine as Flow engine
    participant Pay as CapturePayment
    participant Undo as ReleaseInventory
    participant Journal

    Engine->>Pay: ExecuteAsync
    Pay-->>Engine: Result.Fail(payment.declined)
    Note over Engine: a failure is a value, not an exception
    Engine->>Undo: compensate, in strict reverse order
    Undo-->>Engine: undone
    Engine->>Journal: record the compensation
    Engine-->>Engine: flow ends Failed, effects unwound
```

### View 3 — the runtime, layered

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph L1["1 · Front door — every ingress, one shape"]
        direction LR
        HTTP[HTTP / gRPC]
        BUS[Kafka · RabbitMQ · Service Bus · Redis]
        CRON[Cron]
        CHG[Change feed]
        AG[AI agent / MCP]
    end

    subgraph L2["2 · Runtime core"]
        direction LR
        TE[Trigger engine]
        FE[Flow engine]
        CE[Capability engine]
        PE[Policy engine]
        EE[Event engine]
        SE[Scheduler]
    end

    subgraph L3["3 · Programming model — the load-bearing layer"]
        direction LR
        FL[Flow]
        CA[Capability]
        CX[Context]
        PO[Policy]
        EV[Event]
    end

    subgraph L4["4 · Plugins — infrastructure adapters"]
        direction LR
        PG[PostgreSQL]
        RD[Redis]
        MQ[Brokers]
        MCP[MCP]
    end

    L1 --> L2 --> L3 --> L4

    classDef core fill:#dbeafe,stroke:#1d4ed8,color:#1e3a8a
    class L3 core
```

Everything above layer 3 is an adapter and everything below it is a detail. That
is why the same flow runs behind HTTP, Kafka or a cron schedule with no change to
its body, and why the whole graph can be emitted as a machine-readable manifest at
build time.

### View 4 — the life of a durable instance

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Running: trigger arrives
    Running --> Suspended: waits for a human,<br/>a timer or a webhook
    Suspended --> Running: signal, or the wake instant passes
    Running --> Compensating: a step fails
    Compensating --> Failed: effects unwound
    Running --> Completed: last step commits
    Completed --> [*]
    Failed --> [*]

    note right of Suspended
        A waiting flow costs one database row.
        No thread, no lease, no compute.
    end note
```

A node that dies mid-flow loses nothing: the journal holds every committed step
boundary, and another node picks the instance up and resumes from the frontier.
Measured rehydration cost is **p99 3.6 ms** —
[B7-B8-durability.md](docs/benchmarks/B7-B8-durability.md).

The full specification behind these pictures, in diffable Mermaid, is
[05-Architecture](docs/05-Architecture.md). Where the two disagree, the
specification wins.

## The CRM — a real application, not a demo

Most platforms are introduced with a to-do list. FlowX is introduced with a CRM,
because the interesting questions only appear at that size: dozens of flows,
several roles, a saga that has to undo itself, scheduled sweeps, an agent surface,
row-level security, and a business process the customer expects to change **without
calling a developer**.

`samples/crm` is that application. It exists to prove one claim:

> **A sales process whose transitions, guards and actions are rows an administrator
> rewrites at run time — while the set of actions stays a closed enumeration the
> compiler sees the whole of.**

Both halves matter. Configuration that can do anything is a scripting engine with
no type system; configuration that can do nothing is a rebuild. The CRM draws the
line in one place and defends it with a test.

| | |
|---|---|
| Flows | **87** |
| Capabilities | **96** |
| HTTP routes | **79**, plus 4 cron sweeps, 3 bus subscriptions, 1 agent surface, 1 change feed |
| Tables | **64**, under row-level security |
| Web client | React 19 + TanStack Router/Query, **46 screens** |
| Tests | **591** for the API, **246** for the client |

What it covers, end to end: capture a lead → three subscriptions score, assign and
enrich it → convert it into an account, contact and opportunity as a compensating
saga → quote it, with a discount a representative may not approve → order it →
advance it through a process an administrator configured → sweep what went overdue
→ answer a question about the account from an AI agent.

### The claim, in two screens

**1. The process is data.** Nine stages and nine transitions, each with what has to
hold and what it does — rows in a table, published as a version, with the live deal
count beside each stage.

![The CRM stages setup screen. A published-stages table lists nine stages from Prospecting to Closed Lost with the number of deals sitting in each, and Closed Won and Closed Lost marked as terminal. Below it a published-transitions table lists nine moves, each with the trigger that causes it, the condition that must hold and the action that follows.](docs/screenshots/crm-web/admin/setup-stages.png)

**2. The same process, being worked.** Nothing in the board is hard-coded: the
columns are the rows above.

![The CRM kanban board, opportunities arranged in columns by the configured process stage.](docs/screenshots/crm-web/admin/kanban.png)

Change the rows and the board changes — no rebuild, no deployment. Add a *new kind
of action* and you need a build, because that is a compile-time enumeration on
purpose. [26-CRM-Sample §7.3](docs/26-CRM-Sample.md) argues the line;
`ProcessPublishing.Validate` enforces it.

### The screens

**Sales.** Pipeline, weighted forecast, open work and the largest deal, all from
the tenant's own rows.

![The CRM sales console. A pipeline overview showing open pipeline of $184k, a weighted figure of $129k, one open deal and eight open tasks with one overdue, above a rhythm strip and a bar chart of open work by kind.](docs/screenshots/crm-web/admin/index.png)

**Executive.** The same data, aggregated for a director.

![The CRM executive board, an aggregated view of performance for a director-level reader.](docs/screenshots/crm-web/admin/exec-board.png)

**Service.** A case queue with SLA state — open, breached and awaiting first
response — computed by the server, not by the browser.

![The CRM service console case queue. Three tiles read open 3, breached 3 needing attention, and awaiting first response 3. Below them three cases are listed with priority, status, a late-and-unanswered first-response badge and a resolution due date.](docs/screenshots/crm-web/admin/service-cases.png)

**Setup.** Declaring an entity this build has never heard of, at run time.

![The CRM setup screen for custom objects, listing declared entities and the form that adds one.](docs/screenshots/crm-web/admin/setup-objects.png)

### Authorisation is a server answer, not a UI state

The client never decides what you may do. It asks, the server decides, and the
client renders the server's own sentence — down to the error code.

**What the signed-in token actually holds**, resolved per request, including the
two fields this caller may read but not write:

![The CRM permissions screen. A table titled "what this token holds", enforced on the server on every request, lists crm.read, crm.write, crm.admin and crm.discount.approve with what each unlocks, all marked held. A second panel lists two of ten declared fields the token may not have in full, each marked read but no write.](docs/screenshots/crm-web/admin/setup-permissions.png)

**And the same screen for someone who does not hold it.** This is the picture worth
having: a refusal that names the capability, the permission and the code.

![The list-views setup screen as a sales representative sees it. The panel reads: the request is not permitted — capability crm.config.list requires the crm.admin permission and the caller does not hold it, with the error code authorization.permission_denied.](docs/screenshots/crm-web/rep/setup-list-views.png)

### Every screen, both roles

All 46 screens were captured twice — once as a representative, once as an
administrator — against the running backend on a seeded tenant. Six differ between
the two, and [the index says which](docs/screenshots/crm-web/).

### How the CRM is put together

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    U([Sales user])
    subgraph Client["crm-web · React 19"]
        SH[Shell + navigation]
        FT[Feature screens]
        API[One hook per surface]
    end
    subgraph Server["samples/crm · .NET 10"]
        TR[Generated HTTP triggers]
        FLW[87 flows]
        CAP[96 capabilities]
    end
    DB[(PostgreSQL<br/>64 tables, RLS)]
    MQ{{Broker · optional}}

    U --> SH --> FT --> API
    API -->|POST /api/v1/crm/...| TR --> FLW --> CAP --> DB
    CAP -.outbox.-> MQ -.->|bus trigger| TR

    classDef opt stroke-dasharray: 4 4
    class MQ opt
```

The broker is dashed on purpose. Leave it out and the configured process still
runs — it is driven by the change feed over the outbox. Only the three
`lead.created` subscriptions go quiet, and the sample says so rather than hiding it.

### Lead to cash, as the flows actually run

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor Rep as Sales rep
    participant API as CRM API
    participant Conv as lead.convert<br/>(durable saga)
    participant Proc as Configured process
    participant DB as PostgreSQL

    Rep->>API: POST /leads
    API->>DB: one write + one event, same transaction
    Note over DB: three subscriptions score, assign and enrich

    Rep->>API: POST /lead-conversions
    API->>Conv: convert
    Conv->>DB: account, contact, opportunity
    Note over Conv: each compensation takes the step's INPUT,<br/>so an undo needs nothing the step returned

    Rep->>API: POST /opportunities/triggers
    API->>Proc: announce — the flow does not decide
    Proc->>DB: read stages, guards, actions
    Proc-->>API: the stage the rows say
```

The seam is the last exchange. The flow **announces**; the configured process
**decides**. That is what lets an administrator rewrite the process at run time
with no rebuild and no deployment — while `ProcessPublishing.Validate` keeps the
set of *actions* a closed enumeration the compiler checked.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    direction LR
    [*] --> Qualification
    Qualification --> Discovery: guard passes
    Discovery --> Proposal
    Proposal --> Negotiation
    Negotiation --> Won
    Negotiation --> Lost
    Won --> [*]
    Lost --> [*]

    note right of Proposal
        Stages, guards and actions are ROWS.
        An administrator edits them at run time.
        Adding a new ACTION KIND still needs a build —
        docs/26-CRM-Sample.md §7.3 draws that line.
    end note
```

### Running the CRM yourself

```bash
# 1. The API, against PostgreSQL, seeded with a demo tenant.
FLOWX_POSTGRES_CONNECTION="Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=postgres;Username=postgres" \
CRM_SEED_FILE="$PWD/samples/crm/seed/northwind.json" \
ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development \
  dotnet run --project samples/crm

# 2. The web client. It proxies /api to the server above.
cd samples/crm-web && npm install && npm run dev     # http://localhost:5173
```

Or the whole stack — database, API, client — with `cp .env.example .env` and
`docker compose up --build`.

The full design, with C4 views, the domain and data models and the sequences, is
[26-CRM-Sample](docs/26-CRM-Sample.md).

## The other samples

Ten applications, each named for a claim in the specification it proves — not to
demonstrate syntax. **All ten run.**

| Sample | Proves | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| [ecommerce](samples/ecommerce/) | An ephemeral saga with compensation, over HTTP *and* MCP | nothing |
| [ai-agent](samples/ai-agent/) | Capabilities as agent tools, with real authorisation | nothing |
| [banking](samples/banking/) | A durable transfer saga, redaction reaching a real outbox row | PostgreSQL |
| [workflow](samples/workflow/) | The whole DSL: `Switch`, `Parallel`, `ForEach`, `SubFlow`, human waits | PostgreSQL |
| [scheduler](samples/scheduler/) | Cron at fleet scale: overlap, jitter, missed fires, **no leader election** | PostgreSQL |
| [polling](samples/polling/) | Waiting costs one database row — no thread, no lease | PostgreSQL |
| [healthcare](samples/healthcare/) | Consent, PII redaction, erasure by subject | PostgreSQL |
| [event-driven](samples/event-driven/) | HTTP → broker → change → cron with zero logic changes | PostgreSQL + Redis |
| [realtime-stream](samples/realtime-stream/) | Bounded memory under a slow sink | PostgreSQL + Redis |
| [crm](samples/crm/) | A process an administrator rewrites at run time | PostgreSQL |

[samples/README.md](samples/README.md) carries the full column of what each one
cost, including the four things the platform **refuses** rather than lacks, each
argued in an ADR.

---

## Why this is not "another MediatR"

| Concern | MediatR | MassTransit | Temporal / Dapr Workflow | **FlowX** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Dispatch | runtime reflection | runtime | remote worker | **compile-time, zero-reflection** |
| Durability | none | none | always-on (heavy) | **per-flow profile: ephemeral *or* durable** |
| Triggers | in-proc only | message bus | signals/schedules | **one model for HTTP, bus, cron, stream, AI agent** |
| Policies | manual pipeline behaviors | pipe config | code | **declarative policy graph, compile-composed** |
| Machine-readable architecture | no | no | partial | **`flowx.manifest.json` — first-class artifact** |
| Cost when you don't need it | low | medium | very high | **pay-per-profile** |

The differentiator is not "faster mediator". It is: **one programming model whose
architecture is a compiled, queryable artifact** — see
[13-AI-Native](docs/13-AI-Native.md).

## Where the project actually is

The runtime exists and runs. Ten sample applications run against it, the largest
being the CRM above. The full suite is green: architecture fitness functions,
generator tests, runtime tests, and the sample suites against a real PostgreSQL.

What is **not** finished is stated plainly rather than implied:

- **Build cost is over budget.** The generator adds +46.5 % at 50 flows and
  +67.1 % at 200, against a stated +8 %. The budget has been re-expressed in
  bytes-per-flow and is gated; the percentage is what it is —
  [B12-scale.md](docs/benchmarks/B12-scale.md),
  [ADR-0014](docs/adr/ADR-0014-derived-error-catalogue-vs-build-budget.md).
- **Six of fourteen performance budgets are measured.** The rest have a number and
  no gate, and [14-Performance](docs/14-Performance.md) says which is which in the
  `Gate` column rather than implying they are all enforced.
- **No published NuGet packages yet.** You build from source.

[CHECKLIST.md](CHECKLIST.md) carries the honest current state, including what is
blocked and why. The specification is the contract: code that contradicts it is a
bug in the code, or an ADR that has not been written yet.

## Going to production

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **If you are planning a production deployment, talk to the author first.**
>
> FlowX is Apache-2.0 and you are free to run it however you like — but the
> platform makes deliberate, load-bearing choices that are easy to get wrong from
> the outside. Which execution profile a flow should carry; how tenants are
> isolated; where the journal lives and how it is sized; which of the fourteen
> performance budgets actually applies to your workload and which is still
> unmeasured; what a schedule does when a node dies. Every one of those has a
> right answer for your system, and the wrong answer usually surfaces in
> production rather than in a test.
>
> The author has that context and is glad to help — architecture review, sizing,
> a migration path, or simply a second opinion before you commit. Reach out at
> **[votrongdao@gmail.com](mailto:votrongdao@gmail.com)**, or via
> [GitHub issues](https://github.com/votrongdao/FlowX/issues) and
> [@votrongdao](https://github.com/votrongdao). You will get a far better result
> than reverse-engineering it from the documents.
>
> Read [18-Cloud-Native](docs/18-Cloud-Native.md),
> [15-Security](docs/15-Security.md) and [16-Multi-Tenancy](docs/16-Multi-Tenant.md)
> before you start — and then still ask.
